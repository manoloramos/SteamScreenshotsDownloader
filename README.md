# ðŸ“¸ SteamScreenshotsDownloader v1.0

Having no official way to download and backup all my published screenshots on Steam, I decided to develop a solution of my own.  

This script will allow you to:

- Download all your __public__ Steam screenshots.
- Categorize them in folders by game name.
- Preserve the original date and time on which each screenshot was taken.

## Getting Started

### Install requirements

### Get your Steam64 ID

### Run the script
